Sample data is provided under directory "Samples". Upon successful build, 
a post build event copies the data to the output directory for use.

Please note that the data is time sensitive. The application only displays "upcoming" data in a two week timeframe.
Thus, the dates in the data will need to be changed to upcoming dates within the next two weeks in order to view the 
data in the application. This change will need to be made in events.xml.
